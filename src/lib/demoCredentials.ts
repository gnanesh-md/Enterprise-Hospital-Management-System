/**
 * The demo accounts each login role signs in with.
 *
 * Two separate things have to agree here and previously did not:
 *
 *  - The **local RBAC store** (`RoleDatabase`), which decides which modules the
 *    signed-in user can navigate to. Every account in it uses `password123`.
 *  - The **backend** (`create_default_users` in `hospital-backend/backend/core/auth.py`),
 *    which issues the session cookie that authenticated APIs require -- the AI
 *    prescription splitter and Smart OCR among them. It seeds four accounts,
 *    each with its own password, and none of them is `password123`.
 *
 * The login screen used to auto-fill `password123` for every role, so the
 * backend call always returned 401 and `apiFetch` quietly fell through to the
 * local mock. The user was logged in and nothing looked wrong -- until an
 * authenticated endpoint was needed, at which point uploading a prescription
 * failed with a 401 nobody could see. Hence one table, used for both.
 *
 * Roles with no backend account of their own share the seeded `staff` account:
 * it is only there to obtain a session for the AI endpoints, and every clinical
 * permission still comes from the local RBAC store below.
